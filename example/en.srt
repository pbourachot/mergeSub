That man, Peter--he says
he knows where Jones is going.

516
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:55,350
I think he was looking
for a mineral

517
00:26:55,418 --> 00:26:56,685
named Amphilicite.

518
00:26:56,752 --> 00:26:59,805
It's found mostly under
sizeable deposits of limestone.

519
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:01,940
I overlooked
its significance.

520
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:04,976
Because on its own,
it has no significance.

521
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:06,478
In its natural state,
it's inert.

522
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:08,146
It's not really reactive,
like helium.

523
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:09,614
But if you know how
to process it properly,

524
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:11,616
it can be used as a power source.
- How do you know all this?

525
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:12,734
Because where I'm from,

526
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:14,619
William Bell used
a tiny amount of it

527
00:27:14,704 --> 00:27:15,821
to create a battery.

528
00:27:15,905 --> 00:27:17,105

529
00:27:17,156 --> 00:27:18,373
A battery made
out of rock?

530
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:19,708
Yes, trust me,
with this stuff,

00:27:19,775 --> 00:27:21,159

534
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:28,133

figured out the same process

that Bell did and possibly
how to weaponize it.

643

By God...

to call it.

00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:43,745
And I understand
I deserve it.

647
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,330
No man should do
what I did.

648
00:33:45,397 --> 00:33:48,116
You made a mistake.
That's what being a man is.

649
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:49,885
<i>It was more</i>
<i>than a mistake.</i>

650
00:33:49,952 --> 00:33:52,754
I broke universes.

651
00:33:56,843 --> 00:34:00,295
I asked for a sign
of forgiveness.

652
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:03,048
<i>But I got nothing.</i>

653
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,752
There is no absolution
for me.

654
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:12,357
Well, I don't believe that.

655
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:18,113
I forgive you, Walter.

656
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:26,538
I forgave you
a long time ago.

657
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:29,074
And if I can...

658
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,776
God can.

659
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,257
We both lost our sons.

660
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:47,642
We never watched them...

And if you could
just help him...

667
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,253
Walter, he deserves to go

669

Seems only hours ago
that I asked Peter

00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,534
to be my emissary.

701
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:39,119
<i>I knew that,</i>
<i>despite the accord,</i>

703
00:37:42,674 --> 00:37:45,442
Distrust and trepidation
between our sides--

704
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:49,463
much of it
directed towards me.

705
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:52,599
<i>I also know the truth--</i>

706
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,102
<i>that a new breed</i>
<i>of shape-shifter</i>

707
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,105
had infiltrated
both our worlds.

708
00:37:58,156 --> 00:37:59,323
And the only way
to defeat them

709
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:00,774
<i>meant working together,</i>

<i>our resources</i>

<i>and our talents.</i>

712
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:06,447
I thought that if you
heard this from someone

713
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:08,298
more impartial...

714
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:10,467
You'd see the imperative.

715
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:13,754
That message
is no longer necessary.

716
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:16,173
<i>We know who</i>
<i>our enemy is now.</i>

717
00:38:16,257 --> 00:38:20,928
And that in itself
is a distinct step forward.

718
00:38:22,514 --> 00:38:24,965
Now that we know that Jones
can cross between sides,

719
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:26,100
we can coordinate
our search.

You'll have
our complete support.

721
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:30,804
That's all good,
but you said

722
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:33,607
<i>that only a tiny amount</i>
<i>of this processed mineral</i>

723

through a universe.

00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,528
So what
is he planning?

725
00:38:37,612 --> 00:38:39,346
As far as we can tell,
he's already recovered

726
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:41,615
at least 100 pounds of it.

727
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:43,016
She's right.

728
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:44,451
We'll have to start
trying to game-plan

729
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:45,652
what he's after.

730
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:47,020

<i>to work from,</i>

732

of us every step of the way.

733
00:38:51,192 --> 00:38:52,692
<i>Jones figured</i>
<i>we'd realize</i>

734
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:54,128
<i>he was interested</i>
<i>in the quarry,</i>

735
00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:55,379
<i>so he crossed over</i>
<i>to the other side.</i>

736
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:57,030
We recovered
his transport device.

737
00:38:57,082 --> 00:38:59,166
<i>Yes, but for all we know,</i>
<i>he has more of them.</i>

738
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:01,552

all the cards on this.

00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,017
I know him.

742
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:19,853
And I saw how nervous he was
when I was questioning him.

743
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:22,573
If nothing else,
I'm a variable

744
00:39:22,657 --> 00:39:24,491
that he didn't plan for.

745
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:26,893
So, yes, we will all have
to work together.

746
00:39:30,198 --> 00:39:33,617
But somewhere,
we stopped him once before.

747
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,923
And we can stop
him again.

748
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:44,077

I thought I was
an expert on loss.

Maybe that's
why you're here...
