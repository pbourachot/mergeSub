There's no word
to describe the feeling of waking up

18
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:27,833
and knowing instantly
that something is terribly wrong.

19
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:30,375
If there were, the Baudelaires
would have used that word

20
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,917
when they rose to find
dawn had awoken them,

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,875
and their Uncle Monty had not.

22
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,042
- Uncle Monty?
- Monty?

23
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,667
- Uncle Monty?
- Are you in here?

24
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,208
We all know that
our time in this world is limited,

25
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:18,125
and that eventually all of us
will go to sleep, never to wake up.

26
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,208
Monty...

27
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,833
But that didn't change
how the Baudelaires felt that morning

28
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:31,125
in the room their uncle
had filled so carefully with specimens,

29
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:35,000
and in which he was now
a sort of specimen himself.

30
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,583
How could this happen?

31
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,708
We know exactly how this happened.

32
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:44,125
My, my, my, my, my.

33
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:49,083
What a terrible accident.
Whoever discovers this will be very upset.

34
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,958
"For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come."

35
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,250
You murdered him.

36
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,208
Why, Klaus, I'm surprised.

37
00:02:57,292 --> 00:03:00,875
A smarty-pants boy like you
ought to be able to figure out that

38
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:05,500
jolly old Uncle Monty died
from a snakebite, not murder.

39
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,667
Look at the teeth marks on his cheek.

40
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,833
Look at his cold, waxy face.

41
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:14,083
- Look at his unblinking eyes.
- Stop it!

42
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,667
Stop talking like that.

43
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,625
You're right.
There's no time for chitchat.

44
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,917
We have a ship to catch

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,167
and I'd like to board in time
to have a bottle of wine before lunch.

46
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:27,667
Peru. We're going to Peru.

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,875
We wouldn't go
to the end of the driveway with you,

48
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,958
much less international waters.

49
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:35,708
Well, then I guess I'll have to
take my own luggage.

50
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:41,667
Sunny!

51
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,292
- Let her out this instant.
- She won't be able to breathe.

52
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,292
I'm so tired of having to explain
everything to you.

53
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,833
You're supposed to be so smart,

54
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:50,542
and yet you persistently seem
to forget about this.

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,416
I'll leave some breathing holes for her.

56
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:57,042
- No!
- Stop!

57
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:00,542
I'm kidding. That's not
the suitcase she's in. I don't think.

58
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,042
Please don't hurt her.

59
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,542
Then get in the car.

60
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,625
Really, there's no one to blame
but yourselves.

61
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,917
If you hadn't stranded me at the movies,

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,542
I wouldn't have had to kill Monty
and we'd all be on our way to Peru,

63
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,625
where I would have had to kill Monty.

64
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,792
God, I hate driving stick.

65
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,250
You're just gonna leave him there?

66
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,250
Trust me, he doesn't mind.

67
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,958
Of course, after they discover he's dead,
you'll be long gone,

68
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:40,708
and I'll be taking advantage of
Peru's extremely lax guardianship laws.

69
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:43,167
Why won't...
There we go.

70
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,750
You can't take us out of the country.

71
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,458
Can he?

72
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,250
And who's going to stop me?

73
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,666
Look out!

74
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:08,375
It's extremely rare for an accident
to be a fortunate event.

75
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,000
Luckily for the Baudelaires...

76
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,167
Blasted furnaces of hell!

77
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,917
...this was one of those times.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,125
What were you thinking,

79
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,208
careening down that driveway
like a maniac?

80
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:21,208
Me?
I was driving well below the speed limit.

81
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:23,167
- Mr. Poe.
- Violet Baudelaire?

82
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,333
- I'm so grateful you ran into us.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

83
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:27,208
It was clearly the fault
of the other driver.

84
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,042
I never...

85
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,917
I thought there were three of you.
Ah, there's the baby.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,417
You're not Dr. Montgomery.

87
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,250
My spleen!

88
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:41,167
I think you've ruptured him.

89
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,917
Hello, my name is Stephano.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,375
I'm Dr. Montgomery Montgomery's
new assistant.

91
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,375
I mean, I was. I mean...
I don't know how to say it.

92
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,417
- Uncle Monty's dead.
- That's how to say it.

93
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,750
He's dead? But that... That's terrible.
How did it happen?

94
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,458
He was bitten by a snake.

95
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:04,000
I was on my way now to get the coroner.

96
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,042
The children were too hysterical
to be left here alone.

97
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,708
He wasn't taking us to a coroner.
He was taking us to Peru.

98
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:11,750
What? Wha...? See? Hysterical.

99
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:16,125
No, the children must be confused.
Dr. Montgomery was taking them to Peru.

100
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,042
Last night he called me
to insist on me rearranging

101
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,083
my morning itinerary
to bring them these passports.

102
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,541
He'd want me to have them.

103
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,167
Can't you see, Mr. Poe?
That's Count Olaf.

104
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,500
He's in disguise
and he's trying to take us away.

105
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,000
Who am I? What am I doing?

106
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,375
Don't you miss
the vivid imagination of childhood?

107
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,250
- I never had one.
- An imagination or a childhood?

108
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,542
Children, you must be very distraught
about losing your uncle.

109
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:45,667
Count Olaf is a terrible man
who tried to steal their fortune.

110
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,958
- Really?
- Yes.

111
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:49,042
And do I look
anything like this Count Olaf?

112
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,625
No, you don't.

113
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,583
Count Olaf has one long eyebrow
and he has a very short beard.

114
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,167
You have a very long beard,

115
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,875
and I hope you don't mind me saying so,
no eyebrows at all.

116
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,542
- He shaved his eyebrow.
- And he let his beard grow.

117
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,625
Can't you see? Anyone could see that.

118
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,750
Sunny's right.

119
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,250
Count Olaf has a tattoo on his left ankle.
It looks like an eye.

120
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,667
I hate to trouble you, sir,

121
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,583
but just to put
the children's minds at ease,

122
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:20,292
would you be so kind as to
show us your ankle?

123
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,167
I'd be happy to.

124
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,167
My apologies, Mr. Stephano.

125
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,583
It's no problem.

126
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:07,333
As long as the vehicle is operational,
then we really must be going.

127
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:08,500
- No.
- No.

128
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,875
- No?
- No.

129
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,458
None of us are going anywhere
until the police have been called.

130
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,417
Oh, come on, man.
It's just a fender bender.

131
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,000
About Dr. Montgomery.

132
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,417
What a sensible idea.

133
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,000
It's quite urgent.

134
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,292
First name, Montgomery.
Last name, Montgomery.

135
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,667
No, this isn't a prank call.
Hello? Hello?

136
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,417
I don't care if you have
an audition for Equus.

137
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,292
Get over here now!

138
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,250
I don't understand
how he got rid of his tattoo.

139
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,875
Good news, I managed to get through
to the local sheriff's department.

140
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,417
It seems there's an escaped cow

141
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,333
from a local dairy farm
giving them the runaround,

142
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:45,500
but they assured me they'll send someone
as soon as they're able.

143
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,625
They must have made quick work
of that cow.

144
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:08,500
May I help you, ma'am?

145
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,792
Sir. Uh.

146
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,125
I'm Nurse Lucafont.

147
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,833
Nurse Lucafont.

148
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:17,958
From the local sheriff's department's
medical examiner's office?

149
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,583
From the local...

150
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:26,125
I hear there's been
a terrible accident involving a snake.

151
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,750
That was fast.
I only just now made the call.

152
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,375
I believe, uh...

153
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:35,042
speed is of the essence
in an emergency, sir.

154
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,500
Could I get a cup of coffee?

155
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:43,250
Don't you want to examine the body?

156
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,417
Right, the body.
Lead the way.

157
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
It's right over here in the Reptile Room.

158
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:55,833
Excuse me, but why
are you wearing that mask over your face?

159
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:59,833
I heard there were reptiles.
They... they might be contagious.

160
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:03,792
Reptiles aren't contagious.
Are you sure you're a qualified nurse?

161
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,833
Maybe the children should wait outside.

162
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:09,042
Being in a room with a dead body
could be very traumatic.

163
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,000
We've already been in a room
with a dead body thanks to you.

164
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,792
Oh, yes, thank you, Stephano,
for that excellent point.

165
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:18,500
I must say, you show genuine compassion
for these children.

166
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,791
I appreciate it.

167
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,667
Perhaps I will wait out here
with the children

168
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,333
while you and Nurse Lucafont go in
and examine the body.

169
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,583
The body?

170
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:32,000
Ah, yes, perhaps we should both wait
with the children.

171
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,333
I wouldn't want Nurse Lucafont
to be alone.

172
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:38,042
Oh, I'm sure a nurse has seen
plenty of dead bodies.

173
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,417
Maybe I can wait with the children, too.

174
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,708
Well, that won't work.
Who will perform the examination?

175
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:45,167
Why don't Klaus, Sunny and I
wait with Mr. Poe,

176
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,208
while Stephano goes with Nurse Lucafont
to examine the body?

177
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,458
No, child, please.

178
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:57,250
If I were standing closer to you...
I would slap you in the throat.

179
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,917
That does sound like the best plan.

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,750
Fine. Right this way, nurse.

181
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:08,792
But remember, I will be just
on the other side of this door.

182
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,083
Oh, I'm sorry, children.

183
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:16,708
Dr. Montgomery did seem like
an appropriate guardian for you.

184
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:22,042
He was more than that.
He was much, much more than appropriate.

185
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:27,000
Please don't let him be our new guardian.

186
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,250
Oh, don't be silly, children.

187
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,875
It is quite shocking
that Dr. Montgomery has died,

188
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,250
but I'm not going to simply just hand you
and your fortune over to his assistant.

189
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,292
Not without some very thorough paperwork.

190
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,667
What's happened?
What's wrong?

191
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,167
Nurse Lucafont was startled by a lizard.

192
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,917
- It's a reptile room.
- I didn't know that meant literally.

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,958
Anyway, you've come just in time.
The nurse has just finished her autopsy.

194
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,583
- Did you determine the cause of death?
- Snakebite.

195
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,000
Are you sure?

196
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,708
Uh, two bite marks on his cheek.
Only a snake could've done that.

197
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:13,000
- How terribly tragic. Case closed.
- But Uncle Monty is...

198
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,500
was one of the world's
leading herpetologists.

199
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,958
He would know better than
to let a dangerous snake bite him.

200
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:19,708
I tested his blood.

201
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:25,500
In his veins, I found the venom of one
of the most dangerous snakes in the world.

202
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,333
Good heavens, which one?

203
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:32,500
The incredibly deadly viper.

204
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:35,250
That's impossible.

205
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,042
The incredibly deadly viper
is one of the least dangerous

206
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,458
and most friendly creatures
in the entire animal kingdom.

207
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,958
Come now, Violet.
It's called the incredibly deadly viper.

208
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:45,292
It's a misnomer.

209
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,667
Uncle Monty named it that to scare his
colleagues at the Herpetological Society.

210
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,417
He sounds highly unstable.
Not good guardian material.

211
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,000
He was a wonderful, caring person.

212
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,792
And the incredibly deadly viper
wouldn't hurt anyone and we can prove it.

213
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,208
How can you prove it
when you don't even know where it is?

214
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:04,375
Of course we know where it is.
It's... right...

215
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:09,583
Hmm, fleeing the scene of a crime?
Highly suspicious.

216
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,250
It's all falling into place.

217
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,542
Dr. Montgomery must have forgotten
to lock the cage properly,

218
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,667
allowing the viper to slip out
and kill him.

219
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,875
I suppose we'll never know
what Dr. Montgomery did

220
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,458
to trigger the bloodlust
in its reptile brain.

221
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,542
I myself know nothing about snakes.

222
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,917
I only got here just recently
and scarcely have had time to learn.

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,333
But I hear the slimy creatures
can hold a grudge.

224
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:35,708
That's the trouble with exotic pets.

225
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:37,583
Maybe nature isn't meant to be tamed.

226
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,458
What did you say your name was again?

227
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,208
- I'm Doctor Lucafont.
- Nurse.

228
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,375
- Nurse Lucafont.
- Sorry, uh, what was that?

229
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,833
I'm Nurse Lucafont.

230
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:48,250
I can't understand you under your mask.

231
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,667
I said I'm Nurse Lucafont.

232
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:53,333
Mr. Poe, that's not a nurse at all.

233
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,208
It's one
of Count Olaf's accomplices.

234
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,792
You mean the hook-handed man who worked
as my temporary secretary

235
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,292
and broke the typewriter?

236
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,292
- No.
- Well, I've never met any others.

237
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,708
Besides, I'm sure Count Olaf
is hundreds of miles away.

238
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,667
Or inches.

239
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,833
Exactly. What was that?

240
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:15,292
I mean, the incredibly deadly viper may be
inches away, ready to strike again.

241
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,625
It's struck again.

242
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,208
It's the screeching iguana clock.

243
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,750
It struck again.

244
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:28,417
Oh, will you look at the time?
Well, the SS Prospero departs at 5:00 p.m.

245
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,375
You better go upstairs, children,
and pack for your Peruvian adventure.

246
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,500
Mr. Poe, we can't go with Stephano.

247
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,167
We don't have the proper paperwork
you mentioned.

248
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,667
She's right.
You do seem like a good person,

249
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,625
but the childrens' adventures
abroad will have to wait.

250
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,000
Come on, we really need to be going.

251
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,708
You're not going anywhere.

252
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:46,583
And why not?

253
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,542
Because no one is leaving this house

254
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,417
with a snake on the loose.
Right, nurse?

255
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,750
Yeah. Absolutely.

256
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,042
- But that's absurd.
- That's absurd?

257
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,042
I'm already late for the bank
and I'm up for a very important promotion.

258
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,292
The bank will have to wait.

259
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,167
When your back was turned just now,

260
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,167
Nurse Lucafont informed me that
this entire place is under lockdown.

261
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,958
- You mean...
- Yes! A quarantine!

262
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,625
Your turn.

263
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,250
What?

264
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,333
A quarantine!

265
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,792
How long is that going to take?

266
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,375
Uh, the police.
It's in their hands now.

267
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,208
Oh, that must be them.

268
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,333
I must say, these are some impressive
response times for a house in the country.

269
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,541
Mobile Crime Lab.

270
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,375
At your service.

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,833
- We always get our man.
- Or snake.

272
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,625
- These are Count Olaf's accomplices.
- And they're all wearing costumes.

273
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,000
No, children, these are adults.

274
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,583
Adults don't wear costumes
unless it's for a charity ball,

275
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,250
or they happen to be employed as actors.

276
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,417
They are employed as actors.

277
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,792
You two, create a perimeter.

278
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,875
No one goes in or out of the house
until the reptile is caught.

279
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,625
You two, get that body in the van and back
to the ME for some TLC before it's DOA.

280
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
But you said no one could leave the house.

281
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,958
I meant, uh, no one except you.

282
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,167
Oh!

283
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:29,083
Don't you recognize him?
That's the hook-handed man.

284
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,458
And those two women were
in Count Olaf's play.

285
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:34,208
Oh, children, it's rude to question
police authority.

286
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:37,792
Besides, the women in that play had
ghastly theatrical makeup on their faces,

287
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,375
and this man is opening a can of peaches
with hands, not hooks.

288
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,875
That's Uncle Monty's food.
Stop eating his food.

289
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,875
I was only gonna have a few peaches.

290
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,708
The children lost their uncle today.
I'm sure you can understand.

291
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:52,125
Violet, Klaus, Sunny,
why don't you wait upstairs.

292
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,583
The adults will take care of it from here.

293
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:54,958
But Mr. Poe--

294
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:58,042
The adults will take care of it from here.

295
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,375
Come on, Klaus.

296
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,375
The adults won't take care of anything.
But we will.

297
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:13,250
Now, please, work quickly.
I need to get back to the bank.

298
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:35,833
If you have ever been left out of
an important conversation due to your age,

299
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:38,333
then you know how the Baudelaires felt
as they trudged up the stairs,

300
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:41,917
unable to participate in the conversation
that would determine their fate.

301
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,833
So they decided to hold their own.

302
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:47,917
We know the incredibly deadly viper
didn't kill Uncle Monty.

303
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,958
And we know that Count Olaf did.
Mr. Poe would never believe us.

304
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:52,542
Not without evidence and proof.

305
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:53,875
Nurse Lucafont may be a fake nurse,

306
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,708
but Uncle Monty had two bite marks
like a snake would make.

307
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:57,917
I saw them this morning.

308
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,417
I saw the incredibly deadly viper
this morning, too.

309
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
It was in its cage.

310
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,917
While we were at the parlor,
Count Olaf must have set it loose.

311
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Or worse.

312
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:09,625
I'm sure it's okay, Sunny.
I know you two were close.

313
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,042
If we could find the snake...

314
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,583
If we could find out
how Monty really died...

315
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,458
- We could prove that it's innocent.
- And that Stephano is guilty.

316
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:18,375
And Mr. Poe would have to have
Count Olaf arrested.

317
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,708
We wouldn't have to go to Peru.

318
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,250
If we'd found proof earlier,
maybe we could have saved Uncle Monty.

319
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,625
If we put Count Olaf behind bars,

320
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,000
we can still stop him
from harming anyone else.

321
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,083
Including us.

322
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:32,750
Do you think you can get back inside
the Reptile Room?

323
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,250
I think I might have a way.

324
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,375
It is now necessary for me
to use the hackneyed phrase,

325
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,292
"meanwhile back at the ranch."

326
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,708
The word "hackneyed" here means

327
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,875
"used by so many writers,
it is a tiresome cliché,"

328
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,291
while "meanwhile back at the ranch"
is a phrase used to link

329
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,875
what is going on
in one part of a story with another part,

330
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,500
and has nothing to do with cows
or creamy salad dressing.

331
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,417
When I say, "Meanwhile back at the ranch,"

332
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,792
what I mean is,
meanwhile, back in the Reptile Room,

333
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,042
the adults were having
an adult conversation.

334
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,292
If we place the peaches in a line
leading up to the cage,

335
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,458
perhaps the snake will follow the trail
and then we can trap it inside.

336
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,333
- Do snakes eat peaches?
- Yes.

337
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,083
Maybe we can use the baby.

338
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,042
Keep the banker distracted.

339
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,167
Oh, you know,
these are so good for your skin.

340
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,667
- Are they?
- You wanna try?

341
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,250
- No, thank you. No, really.
- Ah...

342
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,875
- I don't... No. Oh, that's...
- Mmm. Mmm!

343
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:47,083
Oh, orphans, our ship awaits.

344
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,125
Orphans?

345
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:06,625
"Labyrinth" is a word which
means "maze full of secrets and danger,"

346
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,041
and if you're in ancient Greece,

347
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,333
"a monster that is half bull
and extremely unpleasant."

348
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,792
The hedge labyrinth
behind Dr. Montgomery's house

349
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,583
didn't contain a monster.

350
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,083
But as Klaus looked down at it,

351
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:20,792
seeing the way the hedges snaked
to form a familiar sinister eye,

352
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,000
it seemed to contain
both secrets and danger.

353
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,667
Secrets their Uncle Monty
had promised to share...

354
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,583
and the danger of being
so high off the ground.

355
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,375
The reptiles certainly seem--

356
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,625
- Agitated.
- Annoyed.

357
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,792
- Mmm. Maybe they're hungry.
- Maybe they're upset about the murder.

358
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,125
Well, they're animals.
I hardly think they're aware of anything.

359
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,042
Did you say "murder"?

360
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,917
- I meant accident.
- Ah, yes, well...

361
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,833
I'm certainly upset
about being late for the bank,

362
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:51,542
so let's hurry this thing along.
Has anyone seen Stephano?

363
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,208
Uh, he just went to make some coffee.

364
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:55,917
Coffee. Oh, how considerate.

365
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,958
Dr. Montgomery insisted I drive out here
first thing in the morning.

366
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:03,208
That was when he was alive, of course,
and I didn't have time for my morning cup.

367
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,708
I know how you feel.

368
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:09,875
My boss made me come here right away.
I had to miss an important audition.

369
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,292
Audition?

370
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,500
I mean autopsy.
It's medical slang.

371
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,792
- That seems strange.
- Oh, it's totally normal.

372
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,333
We have lots of slang in the ol' med biz.

373
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,625
That's slang for medical business.

374
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:27,167
We call doctors "doc,"
and dead bodies "corpses."

375
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,708
Ah, I suppose...

376
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,333
Even though Uncle Monty's body
had been removed,

377
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:34,083
the Reptile Room was not as inviting
to Klaus as it had been the day before.

378
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,083
What happens in a certain place
can stain your feelings for it,

379
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:40,917
just as ink can stain
a white sheet of paper.

380
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:46,750
You can never forget
what transpired in that place...

381
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,125
just as words in ink
can never be unwritten.

382
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,375
Oh, perhaps I should check
on the children.

383
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,333
Look over there!

384
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:56,208
Where?
What am I looking at?

385
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,792
It's the incredibly deadly viper.

386
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,167
In that cage? But it's locked.

387
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,542
Must've crawled inside.

388
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,833
Locked the cage behind it.

389
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:08,375
But a snake can't operate
a lock by itself.

390
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:12,083
- Maybe a lizard helped it.
- That seems unlikely.

391
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:15,167
Besides, that cage is clearly marked
"Virginian Wolfsnake."

392
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,250
I must say, I'm beginning to doubt
your qualifications.

393
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm totally a nurse.

394
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,125
Well, it does say so on your pin.

395
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,333
- What was that?
- That didn't sound like a snake.

396
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,958
Exactly.

397
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:36,167
That's just
the screeching iguana clock.

398
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,250
It was not the screeching iguana clock.

399
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,500
To fully understand the ghastly scene

400
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,208
the adults discovered in the parlor,

401
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:54,792
it is useful to once again use the phrase
"meanwhile back at the ranch,"

402
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,375
which in this case means "upstairs."

403
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:03,000
And about six minutes earlier.

404
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh, orphans, our ship awaits.

405
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,333
Orphans?

406
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,333
Years later,
Klaus Baudelaire would often lie in bed,

407
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,292
filled with regret that he never yelled

408
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,083
"That man is Count Olaf"
to his uncle at the movies,

409
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,458
or over Chinese food,
or from under his canoe.

410
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:40,667
And while I cannot say
that Violet slept any easier,

411
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,458
she was luckier than her brother
in one respect.

412
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:48,208
She knew that the time to act was now.
And she would not regret it.

413
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,458
You'll be comfortable here.
Do you think you can watch the door?

414
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,333
Do you think you can help me out?

415
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:32,833
Thanks, Sunny.

416
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,416
Sunny?

417
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,917
I'd say partly cloudy.

418
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:13,250
I thought you were
supposed to be a nice girl.

419
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:16,667
Nice girls aren't supposed to dig through
people's personal, private property.

420
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,667
Especially when it's... Wasn't it locked?

421
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,458
- It was.
- Oh, how clever.

422
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:22,250
But I bet you're not clever enough
for this.

423
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,708
I have four tickets with me
to Peru right now.

424
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,417
I was going to take you and your siblings,

425
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,708
because that's just
the kind of guardian I am.

426
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,875
But I'll settle for one of you.

427
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:36,083
That's the screeching iguana clock.

428
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,208
What is...

429
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,292
Which brings us back to...

430
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,042
Goodness, golly, good God,

431
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:54,333
Mary and Joseph, Zeus and Hera,
Nathaniel Hawthorne!

432
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,417
- Which snake is it?
- It's the incredibly deadly viper.

433
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,917
Don't touch her! Grab her!
Move closer! Run away!

434
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,667
Kill the snake! Leave it alone!

435
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,833
Give it some food! Don't let it bite her!

436
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:09,042
It bit her!
It's bitten her! It bited her!

437
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,625
Calm down! Get moving!
Call an ambulance!

438
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:14,375
Call a scientist! Call my wife!

439
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,917
This is ghastly!

440
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,292
This is phantasmagorical!

441
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:22,417
You are police officers! Do something!

442
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,000
- It... it looks like the baby's playing.
- Mmm-hmm.

443
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,375
With the incredibly deadly viper?

444
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:33,125
From the expedition journal
of Dr. Montgomery Montgomery, April 24th.

445
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,583
"The incredibly deadly viper
wouldn't hurt a fly.

446
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:38,167
I know this because
I tried to feed it flies this morning.

447
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,333
It is friendly and kind,
playful and smart,

448
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:42,292
and if you can get past
your first impression,

449
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,208
it can make a wonderful
addition to the family."

450
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,750
And therefore,
it cannot have killed Uncle Monty.

451
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:49,917
Well, I guess it does look
rather harmless.

452
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,750
That doesn't change anything.

453
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,750
There are still plenty of deadly types
of snakes in that room

454
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:55,708
that could have done it.

455
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:58,000
The mamba du mal bites as it strangles.

456
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,125
The irascible python
is homicidally grumpy.

457
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:04,958
The Virginian wolfsnake can bludgeon you
to death with a typewriter.

458
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,625
How do you know?

459
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,917
Because I read up on all types of snakes

460
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,833
in the library section
of the Reptile Room.

461
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:15,958
- Psst, boss.
- Don't interrupt me while I'm talking.

462
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:21,583
If I may say so myself,
I am quite the expert on the snakes.

463
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,542
What does it say?

464
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:28,083
She said, "Ah-ha!"
because she's figured something out.

465
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,875
I myself know nothing about snakes.

466
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:32,042
You said you didn't know
anything about snakes.

467
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,375
I... That is--

468
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:37,625
That's right.
Stephano, explain...

469
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:45,958
- We need a plan.
- Should we kill him?

470
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:48,167
He is coughing a lot.
Let's see if he dies of natural causes.

471
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,083
Mmm.

472
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:54,208
Explain yourself.

473
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:58,333
The reason that I said
I did not know anything about the snakes,

474
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:00,792
is because I was being modest.

475
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:01,958
You weren't being modest.

476
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:04,083
You haven't been modest
a day in your life. You were lying.

477
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:05,667
Klaus, you can't speak
to an adult that way.

478
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,083
And he's lying now.

479
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:09,542
He's a liar and a murderer
and he killed Uncle Monty.

480
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:12,375
You have no proof.

481
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:14,667
Yes, we do.

482
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,208
What is all this?

483
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:20,708
Evidence, which I found
in Stephano's suitcase.

484
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,042
She picked the lock.

485
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,125
- Violet, is that true?
- It was an emergency.

486
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,125
Nice girls shouldn't know
how to do that sort of thing.

487
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,208
That's what I said.

488
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:30,583
My sister is a nice girl... and she knows
how to do all sorts of things.

489
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,500
We'll discuss this later.
Please continue.

490
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:35,708
When Uncle Monty died,
we were immediately suspicious.

491
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:39,125
We were positive
that Stephano killed Uncle Monty.

492
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,542
But there were bite marks on his cheek
clearly from a snake.

493
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:42,917
That stumped me, too.

494
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
That's why I decided
to search Stephano's suitcase.

495
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:47,542
I knew he wouldn't want to leave
any evidence behind.

496
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,458
And that's when I found these.

497
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:53,125
But that's nothing.
It's my random junk collection,

498
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:56,000
which is private property,
illegally obtained,

499
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,750
and therefore not admissible in court.

500
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:01,042
It does look like junk.
But that's when I noticed this.

501
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:04,875
Uncle Monty told us that he keeps
venom samples in his cabinet

502
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:07,500
from every venomous snake known to man.

503
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,875
- And woman.
- And woman.

504
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,792
Mr. Poe, I believe if you open
that cabinet right there,

505
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,333
you'll find a sample is missing.

506
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,917
There's an empty spot on the shelf.

507
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,708
The label says "Mamba du Mal."

508
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:24,125
"The mamba du mal is one of
the deadliest snakes in the hemisphere,

509
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,792
known for its powerful venom."

510
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,583
Then it's obvious.

511
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:32,917
The mamba du mal got out of its cage,
stole a vial of its own venom,

512
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,292
and murdered Dr. Montgomery
in cold blood.

513
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,291
Ah-ha!

514
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,417
Wait, that's ridiculous.

515
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,583
- But the bite marks--
- Aren't bite marks at all.

516
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:44,333
When I first saw these items,
I wasn't sure how they fit together.

517
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:47,500
So, I concentrated on each item
as if they were parts of a machine.

518
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:50,125
And that's when I realized
they fit together.

519
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:54,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the murder weapon.

520
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:56,208
- Incredible!
- Astounding!

521
00:29:56,292 --> 00:30:00,208
Stephano used this double-barrel syringe
to inject the venom into Uncle Monty,

522
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:04,125
to simulate the double puncture marks
of a snake.

523
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,917
Then he disassembled it
to hide the evidence.

524
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,500
But I loved Dr. Montgomery.

525
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:10,500
What motive would I possibly have
to murder him?

526
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:12,583
He's after the Baudelaire fortune.

527
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,750
How would Stephano even know
about the Baudelaire fortune?

528
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:17,083
I thought they were penniless orphans.

529
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,292
They certainly dress
like penniless orphans.

530
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:22,291
That's because everything we owned
burned up in a fire.

531
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,958
But you already know about that...

532
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:28,125
because you're not Stephano,
you're Count Olaf.

533
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:33,292
The kid detective thing is cute,
but we have already dismissed that theory.

534
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,875
We'll see about that.

535
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,500
Your left ankle, sir.

536
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,250
Don't come near me with that thing.

537
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,500
You've been coughing germs
into it all day.

538
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:44,375
Oh, if you're really
who the children say you are,

539
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,167
then germs are the least of your problem.

540
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,792
Your left ankle... please.

541
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,542
If you insist.

542
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:28,625
For the first time in my life,
I'm happy to see that awful tattoo.

543
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:34,667
Bravo, children.

544
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,042
Yes, I admit it. I killed Monty.

545
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:43,625
I also killed his assistant, Gustav.
I drowned him in the reflecting pond.

546
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:47,792
The question is...
what are you going to do about it?

547
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:52,083
I'm going to send you to jail
for a very long time.

548
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,125
Officers, arrest this man!

549
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,125
No, office... Officers.

550
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,625
Oh, you're all in on it, aren't you?

551
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,167
Oh. Oh, dear.

552
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,667
If this were a piece of filmed
entertainment for small children

553
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,042
you would know what happens next.

554
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,458
With the villain's identity
and evil plan exposed,

555
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:11,833
the police would arrive on the scene

556
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:13,458
and place him in jail
for the rest of his life.

557
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:15,541
The plucky youngsters
would go out for pizza.

558
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:19,625
But I can tell you that's as likely
as Dr. Montgomery returning to life.

559
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:22,417
Still, while Dr. Montgomery
may be dead...

560
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,208
If you don't mind,
I'll be taking the children with me.

561
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:28,458
...the reptiles in his collection...

562
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:31,208
were very much alive.

563
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,667
Oh.

564
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,083
Boss.

565
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,833
That's just the screeching iguana clock.

566
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,375
It's not the screeching iguana clock.

567
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,042
It's the screeching iguana!

568
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,417
Take the van.
Make sure they follow you.

569
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,292
- But where are you going, boss?
- International waters.

570
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,542
Count Olaf is driving away.

571
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,042
No, he's not.
He's heading into the labyrinth.

572
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:19,583
I suppose there wasn't room in the van.

573
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:21,042
What are you waiting for?
Go after him!

574
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,792
This is a job for the police.

575
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,667
I'll go call them. I'm sure they'll...

576
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:28,041
set up a roadblock, or something.

577
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:30,458
He's not getting away.

578
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:35,792
Go right.

579
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,417
You go that way. We can cut him off.

580
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:24,417
It's a dead end.

581
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,667
That's impossible.
We can retrace our steps.

582
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,875
What's the point? It's all wrong.

583
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,833
Count Olaf escaped.
Uncle Monty is dead.

584
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:35,500
We never got to go to Peru or say goodbye.

585
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,583
Or ask him about this.

586
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,292
Klaus, what is that?

587
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,042
It's Uncle Monty's handwriting.

588
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:43,042
He must have copied it down
during the movie.

589
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,333
We were right next to him.

590
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,042
If he got a message,
we would've seen it.

591
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,833
Not if he had some secret way
to receive it.

592
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:51,750
Do you remember that strange object
I found in the fire? I think it's...

593
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,083
It's gone.

594
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:55,583
I'll be taking the children with me.

595
00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:58,542
Count Olaf.

596
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,250
A good labyrinth is full of secrets.

597
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,875
- Who are you?
- Why are you dressed as a statue?

598
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:20,125
Both excellent questions, Baudelaires.

599
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,917
You're that actress
from the weird zombie movie.

600
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,292
You work for Mr. Poe.

601
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:24,833
It's more of a volunteer position.

602
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,250
I'm sorry I arrived too late
to help your uncle.

603
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,333
But I can still bring Count Olaf
to justice.

604
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:31,250
Uncle Monty
had a spyglass like that.

605
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,750
What was he trying to tell us?
What's in Peru?

606
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,292
Forget Peru. It's been compromised.

607
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:38,875
Who sent him the message?
Who were we supposed to meet there?

608
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:40,625
I know you children have
a great many questions,

609
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,958
and I promise there are
a great many answers.

610
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:46,375
Find your Aunt Josephine.
She's a fierce and formidable woman.

611
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,167
She can keep you safe
and tell you everything you need to know.

612
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,708
Let me handle Count Olaf.

613
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:55,417
Count Olaf stole something from me.
I think it's part of a spyglass.

614
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,875
It certainly is.

615
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:00,458
I will get it back to you,
Klaus Baudelaire. I promise.

616
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,125
Who are you?

617
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:24,333
What are they doing
with Uncle Monty's reptiles?

618
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:27,083
After I called the police,
I rang up the Herpetological Society.

619
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:30,042
They kindly offered to retrieve
Dr. Montgomery's reptiles.

620
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,417
"Retrieve" means "take away."

621
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,667
We know what retrieve means.
Where are they taking them?

622
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,292
Well, they're orphans now.
So they'll be moving on to other homes

623
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:39,042
where their guardians hopefully
won't die on them like Dr. Montgomery.

624
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,542
Can we at least say goodbye?

625
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:41,792
After what you've been through,

626
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:44,667
I'd think you'd never want to see
a reptile again.

627
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,833
Besides, I have to take you
to your next guardian.

628
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:49,167
- No!
- No! We know where we're going.

629
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,458
I know where you're going, too.
And I'm the adult so I get to decide.

630
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:55,750
- We're going to our Aunt Josephine.
- To your Aunt Josephine.

631
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,000
She's next on the list.

632
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:18,625
Mr. Poe, what can you tell us
about your secretary?

633
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:19,833
Oh, terrible disappointment.

634
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:22,125
He turned out to be working
for Count Olaf. Surely you remember.

635
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:26,000
- No, your other secretary.
- Who? Oh, Jacquelyn.

636
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:29,917
Excellent typist. Unfortunate habit
of disappearing for days at a time.

637
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,125
I don't make it a habit of socializing
with employees,

638
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,833
so that's really all I know.

639
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:37,542
Other than the fact that she came
highly recommended by your parents.

640
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,167
Telegram for a Mr. Count Olaf?

641
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,750
It's just Count Olaf.

642
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:29,125
Count is my honorific.

643
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:33,333
Calling me "Mr." is not only redundant,
it's an insult to my station.

644
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:34,542
Who...

645
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:39,167
Well, we meet again.
You might want to ease up on the bronzer.

646
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,708
I hope you don't think
you're going to Peru.

647
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:44,500
Yessica Haircut.

648
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,917
I find it helpful to leave the country
now and then.

649
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,792
See some ruins, wait for the manhunt
to die down, eat some cuy.

650
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:54,667
You won't be eating any cuy,
unless it's served in a prison cafeteria.

651
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,625
Why would I be eating
in a prison cafeteria?

652
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:58,042
Because I'm taking you to prison.

653
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:00,000
Well, good luck with that. I'm armed.

654
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,792
Hmm. So am I.

655
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:05,542
- Hmm. Child's play.
- Adorable.

656
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:09,042
Is that a harpoon gun?

657
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:10,542
You'd never use it.

658
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:13,250
One of your great gifts
is your eminent compassion.

659
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,125
You wouldn't squash a spider.

660
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,417
I like spiders.

661
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,750
Well, that's good, because there's one
on your shoulder right now.

662
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:20,958
I'm not falling for that.

663
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,625
No, no, I'm serious.
It's on your left shoulder.

664
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:25,292
It's one of the bigger ones.
I wanna say tarantula? Ugh.

665
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:35,292
You're not going anywhere, you snake.

666
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:39,750
You're forgetting, my dear Jacquelyn,
snakes shed their skin.

667
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:56,750
There are times
when the entire world seems wrong.

668
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,792
The way a reptile room
without any reptiles...

669
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,833
seems wrong.

670
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:12,750
The way a bookshelf without any books
seems wrong.

671
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:16,750
Or a loved one's house...

672
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,166
without the loved one.

673
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,667
The Baudelaires weren't given much time
with their Uncle Monty,

674
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,333
which seemed wrong.

675
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:26,083
Still, for the first time in a long time,

676
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:29,125
they'd found a place
where the world seemed right,

677
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:31,167
if only for a short time.

678
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
If they'd found that once,
who's to say they couldn't find it again?

679
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,083
- He's not answering.
- Sure you've got the right number?

680
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,208
Operator, can you check
that number again, please?

681
00:41:03,292 --> 00:41:04,750
It's quite urgent.

682
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:08,250
Yes. Thank you. First name, Montgomery.
Last name, Montgomery.

683
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,625
No, this isn't a crank call.

684
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,625
Can I put you on hold for a moment?

685
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:31,708
Which of you gentlemen knows
where we might charter a plane?
