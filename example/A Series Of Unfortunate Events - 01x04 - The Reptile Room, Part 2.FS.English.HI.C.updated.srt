- Uncle Monty?
- Are you in here?

27
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,108
We all know that
our time in this world is limited,

28
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:12,025
and that eventually all of us
will go to sleep, never to wake up.

Monty...

30
00:02:19,192 --> 00:02:21,733
But that didn't change
how the Baudelaires felt that morning

31
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:25,025
in the room their uncle
had filled so carefully with specimens,

32
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:28,900
and in which he was now
a sort of specimen himself.

33
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,483
- How could this happen?
- (SCOFFS)

34
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,608
We know exactly how this happened.

35
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:38,025
My, my, my, my, my.

36
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:42,983
What a terrible accident.
Whoever discovers this will be very upset.

"For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come."

38
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:48,150
You murdered him.

39
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:51,108
Why, Klaus, I'm surprised.

40
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:54,775
A smarty-pants boy like you
ought to be able to figure out that

41
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:59,400
jolly old Uncle Monty died
from a snakebite, not murder.

42
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,567
Look at the teeth marks on his cheek.

43
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,733
Look at his cold, waxy face.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

44
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:07,983
- Look at his unblinking eyes.
- Stop it!

45
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:09,567
Stop talking like that.

46
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,525
You're right.
There's no time for chitchat.

47
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:13,817
We have a ship to catch

48
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,067
and I'd like to board in time
to have a bottle of wine before lunch.

49
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:21,567
Peru. We're going to Peru.

50
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,775
We wouldn't go
to the end of the driveway with you,

51
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:25,858
much less international waters.

52
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:29,608
Well, then I guess I'll have to
take my own luggage.

- VIOLET:  Let her out this instant.
- KLAUS:  She won't be able to breathe.

56
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:40,192
I'm so tired of having to explain
everything to you.

57
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:41,733
You're supposed to be so smart,

58
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:44,442
and yet you persistently seem
to forget about this.

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,317
I'll leave some breathing holes for her.

60
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:50,942
- KLAUS:  No!
- Stop!

61
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:54,442
I'm kidding. That's not
the suitcase she's in. I don't think.

62
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,942
Please don't hurt her.

63
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:58,442
Then get in the car.

- (GEARS GRINDING)
- If you hadn't stranded me at the movies,

69
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,442
I wouldn't have had to kill Monty
and we'd all be on our way to Peru,

70
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,525
where I would have had to kill Monty.

71
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:23,692
God, I hate driving stick.

72
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:25,150
You're just gonna leave him there?

73
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,150
Trust me, he doesn't mind.

74
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,858
Of course, after they discover he's dead,
you'll be long gone,

75
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:34,608
and I'll be taking advantage of
Peru's extremely lax guardianship laws.

Why won't... (GRUNTING)
There we go.

I was driving well below the speed limit.

- Violet Baudelaire?

- Well, I wouldn't say that.

Hello, my name is Stephano.

I'm Dr. Montgomery Montgomery's
new assistant.

00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:48,275
I mean, I was. I mean...
I don't know how to say it.

101
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:50,317
- Uncle Monty's dead.
- That's how to say it.

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,650
He's dead? But that... That's terrible.
How did it happen?

103
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,358
He was bitten by a snake.

104
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:57,900
I was on my way now to get the coroner.

105
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,942
The children were too hysterical
to be left here alone.

106
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:02,608
He wasn't taking us to a coroner.
He was taking us to Peru.

107
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:05,650
What? Wha...? See? Hysterical.

108
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:10,025
No, the children must be confused.
Dr. Montgomery was taking them to Peru.

109
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:12,942
Last night he called me
to insist on me rearranging

110
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:15,983
my morning itinerary
to bring them these passports.

111
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,442
He'd want me to have them.

112
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:20,067
Can't you see, Mr. Poe?
That's Count Olaf.

He's in disguise
and he's trying to take us away.

(CHUCKLES) Don't you miss
the vivid imagination of childhood?

Children, you must be very distraught
about losing your uncle.

00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:39,567
Count Olaf is a terrible man
who tried to steal their fortune.

- Really?
- Yes.

121
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,942
And do I look
anything like this Count Olaf?

122
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,525
No, you don't.

123
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:47,483
Count Olaf has one long eyebrow
and he has a very short beard.

124
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,067
You have a very long beard,

125
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,775
and I hope you don't mind me saying so,
no eyebrows at all.

126
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:54,442
- He shaved his eyebrow.
- And he let his beard grow.

127
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:56,525
Can't you see? Anyone could see that.

128

- (HISSES)
- KLAUS: Sunny's right.

129
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:04,150
Count Olaf has a tattoo on his left ankle.
It looks like an eye.

I hate to trouble you, sir,

but just to put
the children's minds at ease,

133
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:14,192
would you be so kind as to
show us your ankle? (COUGHING)

- No?
- No.

00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,358
None of us are going anywhere

Oh, come on, man.
It's just a fender bender.

About Dr. Montgomery.

144
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,317
What a sensible idea.

145
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,900
It's quite urgent.

146
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:18,192

Last name, Montgomery.

I don't understand
how he got rid of his tattoo.

Good news, I managed to get through
to the local sheriff's department.

152
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,317
It seems there's an escaped cow

from a local dairy farm

to let a dangerous snake bite him.

colleagues at the Herpetological Society.

Oh, children, it's rude to question
police authority.

306
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:31,692
Besides, the women in that play had
ghastly theatrical makeup on their faces,

307
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:35,275
and this man is opening a can of peaches
with hands, not hooks.

308
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:37,775
That's Uncle Monty's food.
Stop eating his food.

309
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:39,775
I was only gonna have a few peaches.

310
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:43,608
The children lost their uncle today.
I'm sure you can understand.

311
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:46,025
Violet, Klaus, Sunny,
why don't you wait upstairs.

312
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:47,483
The adults will take care of it from here.

313
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:48,858
But Mr. Poe...

Now, please, work quickly.
I need to get back to the bank.

320
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:29,733
If you have ever been left out of
an important conversation due to your age,

321
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:32,233
then you know how the Baudelaires felt
as they trudged up the stairs,

322
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,817
unable to participate in the conversation
that would determine their fate.

323
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,733
So they decided to hold their own.

324
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:41,817
We know the incredibly deadly viper
didn't kill Uncle Monty.

325
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,858
And we know that Count Olaf did.
Mr. Poe would never believe us.

326
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:46,442
Not without evidence and proof.

327
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:47,775
Nurse Lucafont may be a fake nurse,

328
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,608
but Uncle Monty had two bite marks
like a snake would make.

329
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:51,817
I saw them this morning.

330
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,317
I saw the incredibly deadly viper
this morning, too.

331
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
It was in its cage.

332
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:57,817
While we were at the parlor,
Count Olaf must have set it loose.

333
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Or worse.

334
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:03,525
I'm sure it's okay, Sunny.
I know you two were close.

335
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:04,942
If we could find the snake...

336
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,483
If we could find out
how Monty really died...

337
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,358
- We could prove that it's innocent.
- And that Stephano is guilty.

338
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:12,275
And Mr. Poe would have to have
Count Olaf arrested.

339
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,608
- We wouldn't have to go to Peru.
- (SIGHS)

340
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:18,150
If we'd found proof earlier,
maybe we could have saved Uncle Monty.

341
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:20,525
(SIGHS) If we put Count Olaf behind bars,

342
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:22,900
we can still stop him
from harming anyone else.

343
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:23,983
Including us.

344
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:26,650
Do you think you can get back inside
the Reptile Room?

345
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,150
I think I might have a way.

346
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:37,275
It is now necessary for me
to use the hackneyed phrase,

347
00:18:37,358 --> 00:18:39,192
"meanwhile back at the ranch."

348
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:40,608
The word "hackneyed" here means

349
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:43,775
"used by so many writers,
it is a tiresome cliché,"

350
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:46,192
while "meanwhile back at the ranch"
is a phrase used to link

351
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,775
what is going on
in one part of a story with another part,

352
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:51,400
and has nothing to do with cows
or creamy salad dressing.

353
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:53,317
When I say, "Meanwhile back at the ranch,"

354
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,692
what I mean is,
meanwhile, back in the Reptile Room,

355
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:59,942
the adults were having
an adult conversation.

356
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:03,192
If we place the peaches in a line
leading up to the cage,

357
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,358
perhaps the snake will follow the trail
and then we can trap it inside.

358
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:08,233
- Do snakes eat peaches?
- Yes.

359
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:09,983
Maybe we can use the baby.

360
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,942
Keep the banker distracted.

361
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:15,067
Oh, you know,
these are so good for your skin.

362

- Are they?
- You wanna try?

- No, thank you. No, really.

456
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:20,317
I was going to take you and your siblings,

457
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,608
because that's just
the kind of guardian I am.

458
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:26,775
But I'll settle for one of you.

459
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,983
- (SCREECHING)
- That's the screeching iguana clock.

460
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:32,108
- (SCREECHING)
- What is...

461
00:25:32,192 --> 00:25:33,108
(GROANS)

462
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:42,192
Which brings us back to...

463
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,942
Goodness, golly, good God,

464
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:48,233
Mary and Joseph, Zeus and Hera,
Nathaniel Hawthorne!

- (SNAKE HISSING)
- (SUNNY COOING)

466
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:52,317
- BALD MAN:  Which snake is it?
- It's the incredibly deadly viper.

467
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,817
Don't touch her! Grab her!
Move closer! Run away!

468
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,567
Kill the snake! Leave it alone!

469
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,733
Give it some food! Don't let it bite her!

470
00:25:58,817 --> 00:26:02,942
(SHRIEKS) It bit her!
It's bitten her! It bited her!

471
00:26:03,025 --> 00:26:05,525
Calm down! Get moving!
Call an ambulance!

472
00:26:05,608 --> 00:26:08,275
Call a scientist! Call my wife!

473
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,817
This is ghastly!

474
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,192
This is phantasmagorical!
(INHALES DEEPLY)

475
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:16,317
You are police officers! Do something!

476
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,900
- It... it looks like the baby's playing.
- Mmm-hmm.

477
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:20,483
(GIGGLING)

478
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,275
With the incredibly deadly viper?

479
00:26:23,358 --> 00:26:27,025
From the expedition journal
of Dr. Montgomery Montgomery, April 24th.

480
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:29,483
"The incredibly deadly viper
wouldn't hurt a fly.

481
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:32,067
I know this because
I tried to feed it flies this morning.

482
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,233
It is friendly and kind,
playful and smart,

483
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:36,192
and if you can get past
your first impression,

484
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:38,108
it can make a wonderful
addition to the family."

485
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:40,650
And therefore,
it cannot have killed Uncle Monty.

486
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,817
Well, I guess it does look
rather harmless.

487
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,650
That doesn't change anything.

488
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:48,650
There are still plenty of deadly types
of snakes in that room

489
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:49,608
that could have done it.

490
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,900
The mamba du mal bites as it strangles.

491
00:26:51,983 --> 00:26:55,025
The irascible python
is homicidally grumpy.

492
00:26:55,108 --> 00:26:58,858
The Virginian wolfsnake can bludgeon you
to death with a typewriter.

493
00:26:58,942 --> 00:27:00,525
How do you know?

494
00:27:00,608 --> 00:27:02,817
Because I read up on all types of snakes

495
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,733
in the library section
of the Reptile Room.

496
00:27:06,817 --> 00:27:09,858
- (WHISPERS) Psst, boss.
- Don't interrupt me while I'm talking.

497
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:15,483
If I may say so myself,
I am quite the expert on the snakes.

498
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,442
(SHUDDERS) What does it say?

499
00:27:19,525 --> 00:27:21,983
She said, "Ah-ha!"
because she's figured something out.

500
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:23,775
I myself know nothing about snakes.

501
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:25,942
KLAUS: You said you didn't know
anything about snakes.

502
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:28,275
I... That is...

503
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:31,525
That's right.
Stephano, explain... (COUGHING)

504
00:27:38,192 --> 00:27:39,858
- We need a plan.
- Should we kill him?

505
00:27:39,942 --> 00:27:42,067
He is coughing a lot.
Let's see if he dies of natural causes.

506
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,983
- Mmm.
- (COUGHING)

507
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:46,608
(GROANS)

508
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:48,108
Explain yourself.

509
00:27:48,192 --> 00:27:52,233
The reason that I said
I did not know anything about the snakes,

510
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:54,692
is because I was being modest.

511
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:55,858
You weren't being modest.

512
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:57,983
You haven't been modest
a day in your life. You were lying.

513
00:27:58,067 --> 00:27:59,567
Klaus, you can't speak
to an adult that way.

514
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,983
And he's lying now.

515
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:03,442
He's a liar and a murderer
and he killed Uncle Monty.

516
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:06,275
(GASPS) You have no proof.

517
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:08,567
Yes, we do.

518
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:12,108
What is all this?

519
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,608
Evidence, which I found
in Stephano's suitcase.

520
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,942
She picked the lock.

521
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:18,025
- Violet, is that true?
- It was an emergency.

522
00:28:18,108 --> 00:28:20,025
Nice girls shouldn't know
how to do that sort of thing.

523
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:21,108
That's what I said.

524
00:28:21,192 --> 00:28:24,483
My sister is a nice girl... and she knows
how to do all sorts of things.

525
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:26,400
We'll discuss this later.
Please continue.

526
00:28:26,483 --> 00:28:29,608
When Uncle Monty died,
we were immediately suspicious.

527
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:33,025
KLAUS: We were positive
that Stephano killed Uncle Monty.

528
00:28:33,108 --> 00:28:35,442
But there were bite marks on his cheek
clearly from a snake.

529
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:36,817
VIOLET: That stumped me, too.

530
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
That's why I decided
to search Stephano's suitcase.

531
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,442
I knew he wouldn't want to leave
any evidence behind.

532
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:43,358
And that's when I found these.

533
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:47,025
STEPHANO: But that's nothing.
It's my random junk collection,

534
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:49,900
which is private property,
illegally obtained,

535
00:28:49,983 --> 00:28:51,650
and therefore not admissible in court.

536
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:54,942
It does look like junk.
But that's when I noticed this.

537
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:58,775
Uncle Monty told us that he keeps
venom samples in his cabinet

538
00:28:58,858 --> 00:29:01,400
from every venomous snake known to man.

539
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:03,775
- And woman.
- And woman.

540
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:06,692
Mr. Poe, I believe if you open
that cabinet right there,

541
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:09,233
you'll find a sample is missing.

542
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,817
There's an empty spot on the shelf.

543
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,608
The label says "Mamba du Mal."

544
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:18,025
"The mamba du mal is one of
the deadliest snakes in the hemisphere,

545
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:19,692
known for its powerful venom."

546
00:29:21,358 --> 00:29:22,483
Then it's obvious.

547
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:26,817
The mamba du mal got out of its cage,
stole a vial of its own venom,

548
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,192
and murdered Dr. Montgomery
in cold blood.

549
00:29:29,275 --> 00:29:30,192
Ah-ha!

550
00:29:30,983 --> 00:29:32,317
Wait, that's ridiculous.

551
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,483
- But the bite marks...
- VIOLET:  Aren't bite marks at all.

552
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,233
When I first saw these items,
I wasn't sure how they fit together.

553
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:41,400
So, I concentrated on each item
as if they were parts of a machine.

554
00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:44,025
And that's when I realized
they fit together.

555
00:29:44,108 --> 00:29:47,900
Ladies and gentlemen, the murder weapon.

556
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:48,983
(ALL GASP)

557
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:50,108
- Incredible!
- Astounding!

558
00:29:50,192 --> 00:29:54,108
Stephano used this double-barrel syringe
to inject the venom into Uncle Monty,

559
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:58,025
to simulate the double puncture marks
of a snake.

560
00:29:58,108 --> 00:30:00,817
Then he disassembled it
to hide the evidence.

561
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,400
But I loved Dr. Montgomery.

562
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:04,400
What motive would I possibly have
to murder him?

563
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:06,483
He's after the Baudelaire fortune.

564
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:08,650
How would Stephano even know
about the Baudelaire fortune?

565
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:10,983
I thought they were penniless orphans.

566
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:13,192
They certainly dress
like penniless orphans.

567
00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:16,192
That's because everything we owned
burned up in a fire.

568
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:18,858
But you already know about that...

569
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,025

you're Count Olaf.

The kid detective thing is cute,
but we have already dismissed that theory.

572
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:28,775
We'll see about that.

573
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:32,400
Your left ankle, sir.

574
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:34,150
Don't come near me with that thing.

575
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,400
You've been coughing germs
into it all day.

576
00:30:36,483 --> 00:30:38,275
Oh, if you're really
who the children say you are,

577
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:40,067
then germs are the least of your problem.

578
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,692
Your left ankle... please.

579
00:30:46,775 --> 00:30:48,442
If you insist.

580
00:31:19,108 --> 00:31:22,525
For the first time in my life,
I'm happy to see that awful tattoo.

581
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:28,567
Bravo, children.

582
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,942
Yes, I admit it. I killed Monty.

583
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:37,525
I also killed his assistant, Gustav.
I drowned him in the reflecting pond.

584
00:31:37,608 --> 00:31:41,692
The question is...
what are you going to do about it?

585
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:45,983
I'm going to send you to jail
for a very long time.

586
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:48,025
Officers, arrest this man!

587
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,025
No, office... Officers.

588
00:31:53,108 --> 00:31:54,525
Oh, you're all in on it, aren't you?

589
00:31:55,275 --> 00:31:57,067
Oh. Oh, dear.

If this were a piece of filmed

591
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,942
you would know what happens next.

592
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:04,358
With the villain's identity
and evil plan exposed,

593
00:32:04,442 --> 00:32:05,733
the police would arrive on the scene

594
00:32:05,817 --> 00:32:07,358
and place him in jail
for the rest of his life.

595
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:09,442
The plucky youngsters
would go out for pizza.

596
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:13,525
But I can tell you that's as likely
as Dr. Montgomery returning to life.

597
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:16,317
Still, while Dr. Montgomery
may be dead...

I rang up the Herpetological Society.

They kindly offered to retrieve
Dr. Montgomery's reptiles.

We know what retrieve means.
Where are they taking them?

668
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,192
Well, they're orphans now.
So they'll be moving on to other homes

where their guardians hopefully
won't die on them like Dr. Montgomery.

a reptile again.

to your next guardian.

- No! We know where we're going.
